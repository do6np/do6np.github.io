## About

In August 1993 I connected my modem to the phone line for the first time, and a year later I wrote my first e-mail. Although I have a degree in Public Management, computers have been part of my life ever since. During this time some stuff has accumulated, which I now provide on this website.

My first website was created in 1997, this is now the fourth version, still somewhat ugly. Please do not expect exciting stories or private revelations here. What you can find here are my various projects and computer programs of the last 30 years.

## Projects
